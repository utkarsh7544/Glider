# Glider
This repository focuses on designing a hand thrown glider.

# Overview
This project is centered around the design, calculations, and fluid analysis of a hand-thrown glider, emphasizing its aerodynamic efficiency and structural integrity. The development of the hand glider followed a systematic approach, including conceptualization, CAD modeling, aerodynamic calculations, and fluid analysis. The manufacturing was carried out by doing the hot wire cutting of XPS Foam resulting in a mass of just 40 g even with the wingspan of 1 m. The glider demonstrated a glide ratio of 20 with an L/D ratio of 12, validating design efficiency.
